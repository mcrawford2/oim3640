# Review
- variable = how we store data
- type = form of data
- return vs print: return stores data, can be used moving forward, and is not visibly "printed". print does not store data and can not be used as a value, but is printed in the console.
- local vs global variables: local are separate and only used with a specified function

# What I learned
- importing turtle:
   - import turtle
   - t = turtle.Turtle()
- invoke chat ai: ctrl + shift + i
- f string is required: print(f'{result:.2f}'), for formatting
- round rounds to nearest even number
   - round(2.5) = 2
   - round (3.5) = 4
- functions help with decomposition and abstraction
- decomposition: break big problems into smaller, manageable pieces
   - ex/ drone shows become possible by splitting the show into smaller drone tasks
   - each part must work on it's own
   - code is split into modules and functions
- abstraction: hide the details, focus on inputs and outputs
   - ex/ to use a drone, you don't need to understand how it works
   - a function is like a black box, uses function specs or docstrings
- functions:
   - name = how we call it
   - parameters = inputs it can take
   - docstring = explanation of what it does
   - body = the code it runs
   - return value = the result it gives back
- Boolean expressions: true/false
   - x = 5
   - x==5 true, equality
   - x != 3 true, not equal
   - x > 10 false, greater than
   - x >= 5 true, greater than or equal
