# Review
- for i in range (x)        for letter in range (word)
    print (x)                   print (letter)
- i will print the entire count of numbers up to the range number, starting  at 0
- letter will print all characters in order, including spaces
- break to leave a loop, continue to move on to the next iteration

# What I learned
- indexing, slicing, immutability, methods
- regular expressions: to find similarities in string and extract pattern

Slicing
- fruit = 'banana'
- fruit[0:3]  #'ban'

Immuatability
- you can't change a string after it is written in one place
- instead, create a new string
- greeting = 'hello'
- greeting [0] = J #TypeError

Methods (. notation)
- word = hello
- word.upper()  #HELLO
- word.lower()  #hello

# To do
- spellng bee problem
