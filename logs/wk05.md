# What I learned
- if __name__ == "__main__": entry point to file, using def main()
- for vs while: for repeats a known number of times, while keeps going until a condition becomes false
- if you know the count, use for. if you're waiting for a condition, use while
- cntl a to select all, cntl / to comment all
- while True, runs until break
- return can only be used inside a function, but will end a function
