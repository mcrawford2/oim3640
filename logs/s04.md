# What I learned
- version control: the process of saving periodically and having different versions to refer back to
- commit/push: commit is saving in GitHub desktop, push maakes saves visible on GitHub web.
- programming language vs english: programming languages are more formal and alwats have meaning. english is faster evolving and can be more ambiguous. 
- cntl enter vs shift enter vs alt enter
- reiteration and fully reading error messages is important
- types of values: int, float, str, bool (true/false)
- variable = name referring to a value
- expression = code that produces a value
- non-obvous operators:
    - // integer division
    - % module (remainder)
    - ** exponent

# Challenges I faced
- understanding and fixing some of the error messages from chapter 2
