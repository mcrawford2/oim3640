# Review
- int, float, str: types. 1 vs 1.0 vs '1'
- module = mod: gives remainder after division
- / vs //: / gives float result, // gives integer result
- comparing variable names: depends on the purpose of the variable. x/i is good for simple or 
    consecutive numbers. student_count/names is better for code that has larger meaning because
    it is more descriptive
- expression: a = 2, 1 + a, evaluates to 3 but does not do anything with it
- statement: a = 2, print(1+a), prints the result, has a value

# What I learned
- recursive functions: functions that call themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem
- def (ground word for define): used to create a function in python
- base case: condition to stop the recursive function
- always write docstring for every function I create (""")
- bool = boolean: checks whether expression is true or false
- snake style name, not camel
- cntl + /: comments or uncomments selected lines of code

# Questions
- when it is best to switch to command prompt or powershell instead of using the terminal 
  in vs code?
