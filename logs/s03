# What I set up today
- The notebooks section of my workspace, through "File" and "Add folder to workspace"

# What I learned in Chapters 1 + 2
Chapter 1
- arithmetic operators: + - * /
- integers (numbers with no fraction or decimal part) vs floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal point)
- integer division: //, to divide integers and output integer
- exponentation: **
- expression: collection of operators and numbers
- "round" function, "abs" absolute value function
- function call: expression that calls a function, parenthesis are required
- string: sequence of letters, + and * work with strings
- "len" length function for the length of a string
- typs: integer = int, floating point number = float, string = str
- natural languages (evolved naturally, spoken) vs formal languages (designed by people for specific applications)

Chapter 2
- assignment statement: creates a variable. Name of the variable on the left, equals operator, and expression on the right
- state diagram: shows what state each of the variables is in
- variable naming rules: can't begin with a number, no punctuation except underscore, usually all lowercase, no keywords
- must import some Python features
- modules: collections of variables and functions
- dot operator: goes between the name of the module and name of the variable when using a variable in a module
- math functions: math.sqrt (computers square root), math.pow (raises one number to the power of another number)
- statement: unit of code that has an affect but no value
- evaluation: computing the value of an expression
- execution: running the statement
- print function: when evaluating more than one expression, only the most recent value is displayed. To display more than more value use the print function
- argument: expression in parenthesis
- errors: syntax error (structure of program), runtime error (no symtax error but something went wrong), semantic error (runs without generating error messages but did not do what was intended)

# Things that feel unclear right now / Questions for next class
- All of the concepts feel clear, but putting them into practice may be a little more difficult
- No questions, just need practice
